To run the script, copy and paste the code onto a new script in RGui 
(or any other appropriate compiler). Highlight the section in the 
script that you want to run, then run the script.

Question 1 splits the 80% of the data into training data and 20%
of the data into test data.

Question 2 determines the columns in both the training set and the
test set with missing values.

Question 3 deals with the missing data in both the training and test
set. Either columns are removed, rows are removed, or data is 
substituted into the missing spots.

Question 4 determines the 3 most significant attributes after 
performing logistic regression on the training data.

Question 5 finds the accuracy of the regression model and plots the
confusion matrix table and graph of the actual results versus the 
predicted results.

Question 6 finds the AUC of the logistic regression model and plots
the ROC curve of that model.

Question 7 compares the accuracy of using linear kernels for SVM 
models with the accuracy of using radial kernels for SVM models.

Question 8 determines the accuracy of using linear kernels, radial
kernels, polynomial kernels, and sigmoid kernels for SVM models. 
The confusion matrix table and graph for the radial kernal is also
plotted.

Question 9 determines the AUC for the most accurate kernel (in my
case it was the radial kernel) and plots the ROC curve of this SVM
model.
